linuxinfo
=========

LinuxInfo is a modular script to collect generic system information to aid
troubleshooting and the filing of bug reports. It is designed to be easy
to use, and it is packaged using "Makeself" to provide a single runnable
script that outputs a report, "linuxinfo.txt" that can be e-mailed or
pasted wherever needed.

## Running it

    $ ./linuxinfo-1.0.0.run

The script will unpack in a temporary folder, create a report in the current
directory and display it. The filename of the report is "linuxinfo.txt"

## Making it

    $ ./make.sh
